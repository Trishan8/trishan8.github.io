### Abstract: 
Given a topological space $X$ we can compute the cohomology groups(modules) of it. Call them $H^k(X;R)$, where $R$ is the ring of coefficients. we want to give $\bigoplus_k H^{k}(X,R)$ a graded ring structure. In order to do so we have defined cup product, $$\smile : H^{k}(X;R) \times H^{n}(X;R)\to H^{n+k}(X;R)$$

We define this graded ring as $H^*(X;R)$ , ths ring can be a polynomial ring over $R$. The natural qustion arise in our mind when can we write a grared commutative $R$-algebra can as a cup-product algebra $H^\ast(X;R)$ for some space $X$. The answer is affirmative for any algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$. In order to constuct/ get such a space we will introduce `Rational homotopy theory` (as it was done by mathematician D.Quillen).
