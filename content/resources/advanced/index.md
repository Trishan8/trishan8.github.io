- Class notes for most of the course.
- **Additional topics**: Lie groups and matrix expontiation, Fundamental groups.
 #### Assignments
 - **Assignment 1:** Some basic definitions and theorems (Cayley's theorem, Lagrange's theorem, normal subgroups and homomorphism theorems) [Worksheet](Assignment-1.pdf) and [solution](Group-Ass-1.pdf).
 - **Assignment 2:** Some basic definitions and theorems (Permutation groups, Sylow theorems, groups of small orders)[Worksheet](Assignment-2.pdf) and [solution](Group-Ass-2.pdf).
 - **Assignment 3:** Semi direct product, Solvable, Nilpotent groups [Worksheet](Assignment-3.pdf) and [solution](Group-Ass-3.pdf).
-  **Assignment 4 and 5:** Lie group, exponential map [Worksheet](Assignment-4-5.pdf) and [solution](Group-Ass-4.pdf).
