This page hosts various resources that have been beneficial to me, and perhaps they might be helpful to others as well. It includes materials utilized in previous or ongoing courses, as well as the books, papers, and reports I was referenced for specific projects.
 - For my personal reference, I'll also be including solutions to different assignments completed during the courses. Those who prefer not to encounter spoilers for these solutions should avoid accessing this page.  [Other-wise click this link]({{< ref "\advanced" >}}).
